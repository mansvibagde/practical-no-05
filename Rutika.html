    On 6 December 1956, India lost a great soul and a legendary figure who passed away at his home in Delhi, he was none other than Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, (Dr B.R. Ambedkar) popularly known as Babasaheb/Ambedkar-saheb. Dr Babasaheb was born on 14 April 1891; the day in many parts of the country is celebrated as New Year.

Time to time many genius persons were born in India and all were not born with a silver spoon as many of them had to struggle in their life owing to economic, social and other conditions. Dr B.R. Ambedkar was one such person who had to fight in his life because of social stigma, not economic. With his knowledge, wisdom and humanitarian feelings he had proved by caste one cannot be great and one can be great only by deeds.  He was jurist, economist, politician, social reformer, prolific writer and sociologist as a sequel he could reach to the zenith of intellectual excellence. Also, he was the architect of our constitution for which we all are proud as almost same time Pakistan was created but within 25 years East Pakistan became Bangladesh and several times Army rule was observed in Pakistan.

Dr Ambedkar contributed substantially to the formulation of the post-war economic development plan of India. His views towards family planning and development of agriculture are having great relevance today also. He felt the brunt of caste issue when his father retired from the army. In his own words “……my father was employed in the Army.  He held the rank of Subedar at that time.  Since we lived in the cantonment, we had little to do with the world outside the military area.  I had no experience of untouchability”. But after his father’s retirement situation totally changed as he suffered from serious caste issue which I feel is totally against humanity and deplorable. I wish to cite one example here we all know a temple is a place of worship for Hindus so all human beings have the right to visit the temple. But in case of the Kalaram Temple of Nasik city Dalits were not allowed to enter, so Dr. Ambedkar-saheb led a protest outside the temple on 2 March 1930 to allow Dalits to enter the temple.

Dr Ambedkar was appointed first Law Minister in the Cabinet of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. What a coincidence as Pakistan’s first Law and Labour Minister was also from Scheduled Caste (Hindu) community, Sri Jogendra Nath Mandal, hailing from undivided Bengal. He was selected by Mohammed Ali Jinnah, First Governor-General of Pakistan. However, both of them resigned subsequently – Dr Ambedkar resigned in September 1951 and Sri Mandal in October 1950. Sri Mandal later on migrated to India (then Calcutta, now Kolkata).

Dr Ambedkar-saheb although, passed away on 6 December 1956, leaving behind his second wife Dr Sharada Kabir, a Saraswat Brahmin,   but Indians can never forget him. Before winding up I wish to quote a line from a famous Bengali poet, Chandidas, ‘sabar upare manus satya tahar upare nai’ (meaning the ultimate truth is human being, none else).
